        <div style="font-size: 20px;">
            <p>Lana you are done with everything (until you decide to do nurse practitioner)
                and you don't have to stress about any school work like exams and assignments anymore.
                I remember how you told me you were doing phramacy before nursing and you switched to nursing instead.
                You made a really good decision because God knows that the world needs a smart and talented 
                nurse like you to help with all the patients in the hospital. Making that decision was probably not so easy
                because you knew that nursing is the hardest degree and that's when you have to prepare yourself for all the 
                stress and sleepless nights to be able to do good on all your courses. You were doing so well in nursing and 
                it's so cute and sweet seeing how much you love to help people and seeing how empathetic you are. I know that school
                was stressful that time, but then you started upper division nursing and it got a lot harder. But baby even though 
                it was hard, I was so lucky that I got to be there for you and make you feel better.
                <br><br>
                Lana, you feeling better makes me feel so happy because I hate seeing you upset and anxious. You mean so much to me baby 
                and I swear I hardly did much to help. I know you did so much to learn more about studying and it was so admirable to see 
                someone so amazing at learning new things and being so dedicated at accomplishing your goals. I really don't know anyone like you
                and if I didn't know you while studying and met you as a nurse, I would be so blown away at how smart you are because what you do isn't easy.
                I love you so much baby and I really wish I could hold you and keep telling you that you finally made it and how you are completely finished 
                with your nursing education. It's been a really long and stressful journey and I wish you can feel how proud I am of you because
                words cannot describe this feeling. If anything goes wrong, I know who to come to for help and that's my beautiful and talented nurse.
                <br><br>
                Baby, I want to always let everyone know how much you had to overcome to finish nursing school and becoming a full time nursing baby.
                I want them to learn from you and know that after going through hell, you were still able to manage to do extremely well, better than 
                the average student. I want to tell our future kids all about this too when they are older and they are having trouble with school. I want
                them to feel so motivated by their sweet and intelligent mom who knows everything about health and more. Everything you've achieved makes me so speechless
                because nothing was easy. I want to ask you for one thing though and I really wish you'll do it just for me. Baby I want you to be proud of yourself. I don't want you
                to feel like this is nothing because this is everything baby. Not everyone can say they're a nurse and a nurse peds too. You literally have the best job that every nurse fights for, yet you
                have that as your very first job out of school. That is more than amazing baby and you deserve to be proud of yourself. I love you Lana bear congrats on finishing you deserve the world and a new chapter starts now. You are so important to me I'm so fucking proud of you
